# mhdOpenFoam

This repository contains a first version of two solvers for MHD compressible flows, named **mhdCentralFoam** and **mhdPimpleFoam**, and some tests used to verify them.

## mhdCentralFoam
This is a density-based solver based on **rhoCentralFoam** with modifications for ideal and non-ideal MHD flows.

## mhdPimpleFoam
This is a pressure-based solver based on **rhoPimpleFoam** with modifications for ideal and non-ideal MHD flows.
